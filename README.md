# Open AI Tools

Open AI Tools is a free, open-source web application that helps manage APIs related to OpenAI. The goal is to provide a
frontend for all API interactions beyond the playground. You can upload and manage files, start fine-tuning jobs and
manage or cancel them, view all your available models. You can also run text through the moderation endpoint to see if
text is safe.

## Usage

To use Open AI Tools, you can run it locally with the command `npm run dev`. The main branch is continually hosted on
Azure at https://www.openaitools.com.

## Roadmap

The roadmap for Open AI Tools includes:

- Tokenize blocks of text
- Create custom field mappings on top of models (for example, add labels, descriptions, and output samples to a
  fine-tuned model)
- Image Generation & modification
- Whisper
- Perhaps an enhanced playground.

## How it works

The application is ephemeral, meaning that nothing is stored anywhere. All this app does is provide a UI around the
OpenAI Node.js library. You enter your key in the field, and all calls are made as if you were calling them directly
yourself.

## About the project

Open AI Tools uses Chakra UI because that's what the developer is familiar with. It uses JavaScript as the developer is
not proficient with TypeScript but is open to the conversion. Open AI Tools is in its early stages. The developer
created this as a hobby side project and discovered that others might be interested, so they opened it up. They welcome
any and all contributions and trust the community to steer the project in the right direction.

## How to contribute

To contribute to Open AI Tools, you can:

- Open issues
- Create discussions
- Fork the project and submit PRs
